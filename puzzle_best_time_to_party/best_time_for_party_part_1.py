# Exercise 1: 
# Suppose you are yourself a busy celebrity 
# and donâ€™t have complete freedom in choosing when you can go to the party.
# Add arguments to the procedure bestTimeToPartySmart 
# and modify it so it determines the maximum number of celebrities 
# you can see within a given time range between ystart and yend. 
# As with celebrities the interval is [ystart, yend]so you are available 
# at all times t such thatystart <= t < yend.
