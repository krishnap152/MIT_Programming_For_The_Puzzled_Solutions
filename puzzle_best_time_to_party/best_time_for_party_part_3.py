# Given a list of intervals when celebrities will be at the party
# Output is the time that you want to go the party when the maximum number of
# celebrities are still there.

# Clever algorithm that will work with fractional times

# Exercise 3: Imagine that there is a weight associated with each celebrity dependent on how much you like that particular celebrity. This can be represented in the schedule as a 3-tuple, e.g., (6.0, 8.0, 3). The start time is 6.0, end time is 8.0 and the weight is 3. Modify the code so you find the time that the celebrities with maximum total weight are available.
# 


sched3 = [(6.0, 8.0, 2), (6.5, 12.0, 1), (6.5, 7.0, 2), (7.0, 8.0, 2), (7.5, 10.0, 3), (8.0, 9.0, 2),
